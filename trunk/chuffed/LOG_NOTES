# Modified version of chuffed with proof logging

To support logging, there are a few limitations/restrictions.

- Special handling for binary & ternary clauses is disabled, so there
  may be a slight performance hit.

- Decompositions which (internally) introduce variables will abort,
  (since the model has no 'name' for the corresponding variable.)
